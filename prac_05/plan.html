    <h1> Project Plan</h1>

    <h1>Mission Statement:</h1>
    <p> &emsp; The website's primary objective is to maximize profitability for Petite Treats Bakery by advertising its services and wide range of items and products. 
        Furthermore, this website is designed to reassure customers, stimulate demand, introduce new deals and offers, and enhance the company's credibility.
    </p>
    <h1>Goals:</h1>
    <p> &emsp; This website's primary purpose is to provide an online platform from which potential customers can connect with the website and visit the 
        Petite Treats bakery. The aim here is to get at least 40% to 50% of customers to come in and buy something from the store. 
        They currently have 50 to 75 customers a week, so we expect to raise that number by at least 50. Getting their brand name out on the web should 
        help make this objective a reality, and with a well-designed site like the one I'm working on, it should be easy to accomplish. 
    </p>
    <h1>Success Evaluation:</h1>
    <p> &emsp; To evaluate the success in this scenario would be easy. The client wishes to have a 35%  to 40% increase in their business. 
        With the exception of the updated website, the Petite Treats Bakery's other advertisement will remain unchanged for three months, 
        allowing the increase in sales to be credited to it. At the completion of this three-month period and throughout, 
        the number of new customers will be counted and compared. 
        The project would be successful if we achieve our employer's objectives. </p>
    <h1>Target Audience:</h1>
    <p>&emsp; The shop's current customers are local residents of all ages, but the client wants to draw young families and young adults, 
        possibly between the ages of 17 and 35, to their bakery, and this is who the location is targeted at. 
        As a result, I'll need to keep in mind when designing the Petite Treats Bakery website that the client is trying to encourage 
        a younger demographic than what they have currently. The website will have vibrant colors and vigorous pages to entice visitors to sign up. 
        In addition, we may post some deals and offers on the homepage. All these things together will interest new consumers.  </p>

    <h1>Content Analysis:</h1>
    <p>
        &emsp; Petite Treats is a family-run small business that has been running in Kirwan since 2012 and is looking to boost its brand by going online. 
        The bakery specializes in traditional Australian baked goods and is currently located at 123 Prize Lane in Kirwan, Queensland.</p>
    <p>&emsp; The bakery's current customers are area residents of all ages, but the client wants to attract young families and young adults, 
        possibly between 17 to 35, to their bakery, and this is who the location is aimed at. Based on what they've seen on other websites, 
        they'd like to prefer 7–8 pages with the following content:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Navigation</b> – Should use horizontal navigation at the top. Links should be repeated in the footer.</li>
            <li><b>Home page</b> – It should be very appealing and drive interest in the bakery. 
                The page should include some sample images of the products to be displayed to attract the site visitors’ attention. <br>
                a. Customers can sign up for weekly specials! <br>
                b. The home page should have customer’s feedback.
            </li>
            <li><b>About us</b> - The website should provide details about the new bakery, which is conveniently located near Willows Shopping Centre. </li>
            <li><b>Menu (image gallery)</b> - This page will have six images that link to 6 pages with details about each bakery item. 
                The menu can be on the home page or on a separate page. The products that would like to showcase are: <br>
                a. Donuts ($4.50) <br>
                b. Vanilla Slice ($4.50) <br>

            </li>     
            <li><b>Special page</b> - This will have 3-4 items on special (25% off, in-store only, you pick the items!). 
                The page should show pictures of the items and sales price. </li>
            <li>
                <b>Footer information</b> - <br>
                a. Contacts: 0455 5555 555 <br>

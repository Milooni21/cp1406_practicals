<H3>Run the Messier Marathon</H3>
<P><IMG SRC="M20.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=49 WIDTH=50 VSPACE=2>
It's time for the annual <B>Messier Marathon</B>. Instead of lacing up their 
Nikes, amateur astronomers will be hauling telescopes, star charts, and a 
hefty pot of coffee in an all-night vigil hunting the Messier objects.</P>

<P><B>Messier objects</B> are stellar objects, classified by astronomer 
<B>Charles Messier</B> in the 18th century, ranging from distant galaxies to 
star clusters to stellar nebula. March is the only month in the year in which 
all 110 Messier objects are in the sky. Unfortunately, if you want to see all 
of them, you have to start looking right after sunset and continue until just 
before sunrise &#151; hence the term, "marathon."</P>
</div>
<P>Ironically, Charles Messier wasn't all that interested in his objects. He 
made the list in order to <I>avoid</I> seeing them. Messier was more 
interested in discovering new comets and these beautiful stellar objects 
were often mistaken for comets before Messier made his list.</P>

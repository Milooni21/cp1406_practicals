            <b>Adrienne Michowski</b><br>
            She is an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, 
            the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. 
            Because of this, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer. She trains clients in programming and longevity.
